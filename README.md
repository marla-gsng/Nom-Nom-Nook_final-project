# The NOM NOM NOOK - Recipe Page

**Nom Nom Nook** is a recipe page designed for both seasoned cooks and beginners who crave clear, step-by-step instructions without the usual distractions found on other cooking sites. This project was born out of my passion for cooking and my desire to create a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built from scratch using React, CSS, and Tailwind for a responsive and visually appealing interface. Google Fonts were used for typography, and a custom color theme was chosen with the help of a color picker. The only external asset is the hero image, which is AI-generated.

- **Backend**: A robust backend supports the website, providing features to manage users, recipes, ingredients, and steps.

- **Admin Panel**: The admin panel, which allows for management of users, recipes, ingredients and steps was created using a template from Marmelab. This ensures a reliable and efficient interface for managing the site's content.

## Getting Started

Explore the site through its intuitive interface, where you can:

- **Search and Explore Recipes**: Use the search bar on the homepage to find recipes. Once you select a recipe, you'll be redirected to a detailed page with all the information you need.
- **User Authentication**: You can sign in, sign out, register, and manage your profile. As a registered user, youâ€™ll have access to your own profile page where you can save and view your favorite recipes.

- **Favorites and Profiles**: Add your favorite recipes to your profile. All your favorites are conveniently displayed in one place.

- **Recipe Page**: Browse all available recipes on the site. Although users cannot add their own recipes, admins can manage and add new content. Once logged in, you can favorite recipes, which will then be saved to your profile. Additionally, there's a feature to keep your screen awake while cooking to avoid interruptions.

- **Recipe Details**: The recipe page is thoughtfully designed, with features like:
  - A separate window for ingredients, allowing you to view them without toggling back and forth between instructions.
  - A checklist to tick off ingredients as you use them.
  - A "Let's Cook" button that breaks down the recipe into individual steps for easier cooking.

## Future Development

Future enhancements will include a **Pantry** feature where users can add ingredients they have at home. This will help users manage their pantry and see what ingredients they already have for a recipe.
